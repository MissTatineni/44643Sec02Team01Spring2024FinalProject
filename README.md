An efficient “ride-sharing” iOS application where users can publish or find rides for their desired routes. 

### Project Details:
The app allows users to post ride availability in advance, specifying the number of available seats from a source to a destination. Additionally, individuals searching for rides on a specific route can view and connect with the available rides. Users can also filter ride availability based on the pricing.
